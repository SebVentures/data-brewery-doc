Logging and notifications
==========================

It is of paramount importance to be able to track what is happening in the ETL process
and be informed timely if there is an issue.

Logging
--------

Logging allows you to dig into the detail of what happened, or is happening,
in the ETL process.

You can check the :ref:`logging page on how to follow what happen <logging>`.


Notifications
---------------

Notifications are ways to let you now when the ETL process succeed or failed.
We currently provide two ways to get this information : 
:ref:`emails <notification_email>` and :ref:`Slack webhooks <notification_slack>` .
